# Pharma Sales Forecasting
The project "Pharma Sales Forecasting" comprises of two parts :
- Time Series Analysis of the Pharama Sales data collected over a period of 6 years.
- Long term Forecasting of pharma sales using several models.

<br>
The two phases have been decsribed in detail:
<br>

Phase 1 involved following steps:
1. Read the required libraries.
2. Read the time series datasets.
3. Perform some time series analysis:
	- Seasonality Analysis
	- Trend analysis
	- Stationarity Analysis
	- Trend Stationarity
	- Regularity Analysis
	- Autocorrelation Analysis
	- Data Distribution Analysis
<br>
<br>
Phase 2 involved following steps:

1. Define function to calculate Mean Abolute Percentage Error.
2. Define a variable to store the MSE and MAPE results for all forecasting models.
3. Use the Forescating models:
	- Average Method Forecasting 
	- ARIMA Forecating 
	- Forecasting with Vanilla LSTM  
	- Forecasting with Stacked LSTM  
	- Forecasting with Bidirectional LSTM
